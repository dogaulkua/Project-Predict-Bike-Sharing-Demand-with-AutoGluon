- **Challenge**: Predict total bike rentals for each hour in the test set

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains hourly rental data spanning two years with the following features:

### Original Features
- **datetime**: Hourly date + timestamp
- **season**: 1=spring, 2=summer, 3=fall, 4=winter
- **holiday**: Whether the day is a holiday
- **workingday**: Whether the day is neither weekend nor holiday
- **weather**: Weather conditions (1-4 scale)
- **temp**: Temperature in Celsius
- **atemp**: "Feels like" temperature in Celsius
- **humidity**: Relative humidity
- **windspeed**: Wind speed
- **casual**: Non-registered user rentals
- **registered**: Registered user rentals
- **count**: Total rentals (target variable)
